# CPE - 602 Fall 2024 Final Project

## Tower of Hanoi | Reve's Puzzle
This project contains the program to visualize the steps and solutions for both Tower of Hanoi and Reve's Puzzle. It allows for user input for the number of disks for each algorithm and contains various preset test cases that are initially commented out to observe how the algorithms run with varying numbers of disks.

**Functions:**
- FrameStewart(numDisks, startRod, midRod1, midRod2, endRod, moves)
- TowerOfHanoi(numDisks, k, startRod, middleRod, endRod, moves)

Run the program using `python TowerOfHanoi.py`
